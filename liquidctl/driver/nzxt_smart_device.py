"""USB driver for the NZXT Smart Device and Grid+ V3.


Smart Device
------------

The NZXT Smart Device is a fan and LED controller that ships with the H200i,
H400i, H500i and H700i cases.

It provides three independent fan channels with standard 4-pin connectors.
Both PWM and DC control is supported, and the device automatically chooses the
appropriate mode for each channel.

Additionally, up to four chained HUE+ LED strips, or five Aer RGB fans, can be
driven from only RGB channel available.  The firmware installed on the device
exposes several color presets, most of them common to other NZXT products.

The device recognizes the type of accessory connected by measuring the
resistance between the FD and GND lines.[1][2]  In normal usage accessories
should not be mixed.

A microphone is also present onboard, for noise level optimization through CAM
and AI.  NZXT calls this feature Adaptive Noise Reduction (ANR).

[1] https://forum.level1techs.com/t/nzxt-hue-a-look-inside/104836
[2] In parallel: 10 kOhm per Hue+ strip, 16 kOhm per Aer RGB fan.


Grid+ V3
--------

The NZXT Grid+ V3 is a fan controller very similar to the Smart Device.
Comparing the two, the Grid+ has more fan channels (six in total), and no
support for LEDs.


Driver
------

This driver implements all features available at the hardware level:

 - initialization
 - detection of connected fans and LED strips
 - control of fan speeds per channel
 - monitoring of fan presence, control mode, speed, voltage and current
 - control of lighting modes and colors
 - reporting of LED accessory count and type
 - monitoring of noise level (from the onboard microphone)
 - reporting of firmware version

Software based features offered by CAM, like ANR, have not been implemented.

After powering on from Mechanical Off, or if there have been hardware changes,
the devices must be manually initialized by calling `initialize()`.  This will
cause all connected fans and LED accessories to be detected, and enable status
updates.  It is recommended to initialize the devices at every boot.
