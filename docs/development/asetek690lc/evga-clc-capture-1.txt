Using filter

  usb.data_flag == 0 || usb.transfer_type == 0x02

to show only relevant data packets plus all control packets (including errors).

Connect:

1  URB_CONTROL  out  bmRequestType=0x40  bRequest=0    wValue=0xffff  wIndex=0  wLength=0  // -EPIPE!
2  URB_CONTROL  out  bmRequestType=0x40  bRequest=2    wValue=0x0002  wIndex=0  wLength=0
3  URB_CONTROL  in   bmRequestType=0xc0  bRequest=255  wValue=0x370b  wIndex=0  wLength=1  // -EPIPE!
4  URB_CONTROL  out  bmRequestType=0x40  bRequest=0    wValue=0x0000  wIndex=0  wLength=0  // -EPIPE!

bmRequestType=0x40: CTRL_OUT | CTRL_TYPE_VENDOR | CTRL_RECIPIENT_DEVICE
bmRequestType=0xc0: CTRL_IN  | CTRL_TYPE_VENDOR | CTRL_RECIPIENT_DEVICE

Connect (interpreted):

1  out non understood request (0, 0xffff)        // -EPIPE
2  out usbxpress clear to send
3  in  unknown request                           // -EPIPE  (TODO check usbexpress docs/sdk)
4  out invalid get_status (wLength should be 2)  // -EPIPE  (TODO check linux usb)

It is probably enough to do send the "clear to send" usbxpress configuration message.

Additionally, no endpoint clearing/halting is observed, as that would require:

   URB_CONTROL out  bmRequestType=0x02  bRequest=1    wValue=0x0000  wIndex=130  wLength=0
   URB_CONTROL out  bmRequestType=0x02  bRequest=1    wValue=0x0000  wIndex=2    wLength=0

Change pump speed:

2  URB_BULK     out  13:32

After 2 seconds the reported pump speed changed from 1260 (0x04ec) rpm to 1290 (0x050a) rpm.

Notes:

 - minimum fan duty set by FlowControl: 25%
 - FlowControl seems to use "Configure fan profile" to only repeatedly set fixed speeds

 - "Unknown command" requests appear just after the first "Configure device" request is seen

Requests 1-3 might be unrelated to the disconnection procedure, but bulk request 0x21 was not seen elsewhere.
